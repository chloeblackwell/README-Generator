# README-Generator

For this assignment, we were tasked to make a command line application that generates a README file from a user's input. This application is a quick and easy way to create README files which allows a creator to spend more time on the project and less time on the README file.

## Contents 

This application consists of 1 main page, index.js and 2 pages inside the utils folder, generateMarkdown.js and api.js. It also has a package.json for the modules that are used, which are inquirer and axios.
